# One Up Database

![1^up](./public/assets/1updblogo.png)


## Description

1^DB ("One Up DB") is an interactive database where video game fans use sign up and login functionality through passport, and bcrypt to create a profile on our database using mysql and sequelize that lets them search for their favorite video games using axios, express, and the IGDB api and curate a list of their favorites. Users can also add friends through our database and send them recommendations for games and also add a bio and profile picture to their profiles.

## Motivation

We wanted to create an app that let users find their favorite games, learn more about them, and be able to recommend them to their friends.

## User Stories

As a gamer this app lets me find any game i could think of and share it with my friends!

As a parent this app lets me stay up to date with what games my children are playing while on their game consoles.

As a student
